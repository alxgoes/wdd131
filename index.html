                    <p>
                        My name is Alex, and people usually call me by that name. I was born and spent most of my life in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo. For a period of two years, I had the privilege of going to the BrasÃ­lia region to provide volunteer service, helping many people overcome difficulties in their lives, both emotional and physical. I love technology and enjoy learning more about how it works; I have always had a strong connection with it since childhood.

                        Brazil is the largest country in South America, renowned for its cultural and natural diversity. It is home to the Amazon Rainforest, the worldâ€™s largest tropical forest, and boasts an extensive coastline with stunning beaches. The country is famous for its Carnival, one of the biggest popular festivals in the world, and for its passion for football. Additionally, Brazil has a diverse economy, being one of the largest producers of coffee and soybeans. Music and dance, such as samba and bossa nova, are also iconic elements of Brazilian culture.
